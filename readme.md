810001 ROBOT SHIELD
===================
The Robot Shield is designed to connect to the Parallax Quickstart: http://www.parallax.com/product/40000

The Quickstart is a great board that included the Parallax Propeller, an 8-core microcontroller.  But there aren't a lot
of nice compact options to connect the Quickstart to a physical system, like your new pet robot.  That's where the 
Robot Shield comes in!  Here are some of its features:

* 5 GPIO Pins
* 8 Analog Inputs
* 4 Ultrasonic Input Pins (can also be used as GPIO).
* 4 Servo Outputs that are powered off an external power source.
* SD Card slot
* ... And More!

To get you started, we have provided a nice demo of hooking up a a Robot to the Quickstart and the Robot Shield and 
controlling by a laptop GUI.
